### Goal: Develop a web-based RSS reader using containerized Angular and SpringBoot.

Done:
- Initial Angular setup with docker

I will not be utilizeing kubernetes in the project for a while. After starting the project I decided to change course but I wanted to keep the same url. On the branch named alex/aws_initial_deployment I worked my way through a few articles and tutorials to get a demo cluster setup on AWS.
